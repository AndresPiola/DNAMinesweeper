Coder, who worked on a Minesweeper project left your company. You have to finish their work.
Designer, who used to work with Coder asked you to fix the project and implement some features.

Issues to fix:

1.) Sometimes the editor crashes during play.

2.) Designer wanted to set the size of the field container based on ColumnNum and RowNum. They added the logic to the widget, but it does not work for some reason.

3.) The UI doesn't show up in packaged game, if the package was created with the shipping configuration.


Features to add:

1.) When an empty field with no mines around it is revealed, the neighboring fields should also be revealed. Just like in the minesweeper Designer used to play on his Windows 98!

2.) A flag behavior should be implemented. Right click on a not yet revealed field should mark it with a flag. That way the player can mark fields they suspect to be mines.

3.) The not yet found mine count should be displayed. The flagged fields should also modify this number.

4.) A difficulty slider should be added to the widget. It should influence the amount of mines spawned.
